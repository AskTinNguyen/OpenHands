# Understanding the Delegator Agent 🎯

## What is the Delegator Agent?

The Delegator Agent is like a project manager in the OpenHands system. It's responsible for coordinating different specialized agents to complete a task efficiently. Think of it as a conductor in an orchestra, making sure each instrument (agent) plays its part at the right time.

## How Does It Work? 🔄

The Delegator Agent follows a specific workflow:

1. **Initial Study Phase** 📚
   - When a new task arrives, it first delegates to the `StudyRepoForTaskAgent`
   - This agent analyzes the codebase to understand the context
   - Produces a summary of relevant information

2. **Implementation Phase** 💻
   - Next, it hands off the task to the `CoderAgent`
   - Provides both the original task and the study summary
   - The coder attempts to implement the solution

3. **Verification Phase** ✅
   - Delegates to the `VerifierAgent`
   - Checks if the implementation meets the requirements
   - Decides whether the task is complete

4. **Iteration Loop** 🔁
   - If verification fails, returns to the CoderAgent
   - Provides feedback for improvements
   - This cycle continues until the task is completed successfully

## Key Features

### State Management
- Maintains a `current_delegate` to track the current phase
- Processes observations from previous actions
- Makes decisions based on agent feedback

### Task Flow Control
```
Study → Code → Verify → (if needed) → Code again
```

### Error Handling
- Validates observation types
- Checks for invalid delegate states
- Ensures proper task handoff between agents

## When Does It Finish?

The Delegator Agent completes its task when:
1. The VerifierAgent confirms task completion
2. All requirements are met
3. No further iterations are needed

## Code Example

Here's a simplified view of how it delegates:

```python
if current_delegate == 'study':
    # Delegate to StudyRepoForTaskAgent
    return AgentDelegateAction(
        agent='StudyRepoForTaskAgent',
        inputs={'task': task}
    )
elif current_delegate == 'coder':
    # Delegate to CoderAgent
    return AgentDelegateAction(
        agent='CoderAgent',
        inputs={
            'task': goal,
            'summary': study_summary
        }
    )
elif current_delegate == 'verifier':
    # Delegate to VerifierAgent
    return AgentDelegateAction(
        agent='VerifierAgent',
        inputs={'task': goal}
    )
```

## Best Practices 🌟

1. **Task Clarity**
   - Provide clear, specific tasks
   - Include any relevant context
   - Specify expected outcomes

2. **Patience**
   - Allow the full cycle to complete
   - Don't interrupt the verification process
   - Trust the iteration process

3. **Monitoring**
   - Watch the delegation flow
   - Check agent outputs
   - Verify progress at each step

## Common Scenarios

### Success Path
1. User submits task
2. Study phase completes
3. Coder implements solution
4. Verifier approves
5. Task completes

### Iteration Path
1. User submits task
2. Study phase completes
3. Coder implements solution
4. Verifier finds issues
5. Returns to coder
6. Process repeats until verified

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Stuck in Loop**
   - Check if task requirements are clear
   - Verify if task is achievable
   - Consider breaking down into smaller tasks

2. **Invalid Delegate State**
   - Ensure proper initialization
   - Check for interrupted workflows
   - Restart the delegation process

3. **Missing Observations**
   - Verify agent responses
   - Check for communication errors
   - Ensure proper handoff between agents

## Tips for Success 💡

1. Be specific with task requirements
2. Allow sufficient time for each phase
3. Monitor the delegation flow
4. Review agent feedback
5. Trust the iteration process

## Conclusion

The Delegator Agent is a crucial component that orchestrates the collaboration between different specialized agents in OpenHands. By following a structured approach of study, implementation, and verification, it ensures tasks are completed effectively and accurately.
